Modelproject - An analysis of the overlapping generations model

We have made an analysis of the overlapping generations model.
The model starts of with the househould optimization problem and the budget constraint
followed by their solutions.

The focus of the project is to define and code funciton that can interact with changing variables.
As a part of the focus the Jupyter Lab Notebook contains a interactive graph which proves that the goal has been accomplished.

The project contains a Jupyter Lab Notebook. By running this notebook chronologically you will be able to produce our results.

NB! The interactive graph can only be produced in the Jupyter Lab Notebook. Running it in visual studio will not produce any usefull results.
