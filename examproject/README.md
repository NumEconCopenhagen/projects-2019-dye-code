Examproject - Three problems to be solved

Problem 1: Human capital accumulation

The problem here is to find out if the consumers choose to work or not. This is solved by maximizing
her choices over two periods and figure out her optimal level of human capital


Problem 2: AS-AD Model

The problem here is to investigate a shock in the AS-AD Model.

NB! We have only answered question 2.1


Problem 3: Exchange economy

In this problem we aim to find consumer behavior and using the consumers demand and supply function
we are able to determine excess demand thus leading us to find the equilibrium prices in the exchange economy.

NB! Question 3.5 has not been solved.
